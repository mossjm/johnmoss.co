# Concept 02: Swiss Minimalist

## Design Rationale

Clean, grid-based design inspired by Swiss/International typography. Uses Inter font, strict alignment, and calculated whitespace. Precision and clarity above all.

**Key Elements:**
- Inter font family throughout
- White background (#FFFFFF)
- Black text (#111111)
- Strict grid alignment
- Thin horizontal rules as dividers
- Uppercase section labels

**Target Feel:** Precise, professional, engineered. Like a well-designed annual report.

**Best For:** Investors and partners who appreciate clean, no-nonsense presentation.
