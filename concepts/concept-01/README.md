# Concept 01: Classic Serif

## Design Rationale

Traditional editorial aesthetic using serif typography (Georgia/Playfair). Evokes trust, permanence, and credibility—like a well-established publication or family business with deep roots.

**Key Elements:**
- Playfair Display for headings
- Georgia for body text
- Warm cream/ivory background (#FAFAF5)
- Deep charcoal text (#2A2A2A)
- Generous whitespace and traditional margins
- No imagery—pure typography

**Target Feel:** Timeless, trustworthy, legacy-minded. Like reading a quality print publication.

**Best For:** Board members and partners who value tradition and substance over flash.
