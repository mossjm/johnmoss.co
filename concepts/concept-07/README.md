# Concept 07: Card-Based

## Design Rationale

Projects presented as distinct, modular cards. Visual hierarchy through card elevation and spacing. Easy to scan and understand at a glance.

**Key Elements:**
- Light gray background (#F5F5F5)
- White cards with subtle shadows
- Manrope font (geometric, modern)
- Clear card categories
- Hover states for interactivity

**Target Feel:** Organized, modular, portfolio-like. Each project stands on its own.

**Best For:** Those who want to quickly understand the scope of work.

## Run Locally
