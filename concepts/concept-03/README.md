# Concept 03: Earth & Agriculture

## Design Rationale

Subtle earth tones that nod to agricultural heritage without being rustic or cliché. Warm, grounded color palette suggests connection to the land.

**Key Elements:**
- Warm off-white background (#F7F5F0)
- Deep forest green accent (#2D4A3E)
- Terracotta for highlights (#9A6B4C)
- Source Serif Pro for headings
- System sans-serif for body

**Target Feel:** Grounded, authentic, connected to the land but modern in execution.

**Best For:** Agricultural partners and customers who appreciate heritage.
